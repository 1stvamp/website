In this weeks episode, we catch up with the Juju Benchmarking team to discuss
their new product launch - titled very appropriately: "Benchmarking". This
takes a fresh approach to performing repeatable, scalable, automated Benchmarking
of your workload in the cloud, on prem, and in a variety of other scenarios.

Marco Ceppi as the project lead gives us the deep dive into why benchmarking is
such a focus for the Juju team. Adam Israel provides insights into how to
compose benchmarks for Juju Charms and what considerations were in mind when
creating the benchmark actions. Tim Vansteenburgh covers the Benchmark GUI and
how it aids in the human interfacing of Benchmarking.
