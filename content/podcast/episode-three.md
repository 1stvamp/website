In this weeks episode we catch up with Whit Morriss of fame and infamy from
the Juju new workloads team, who has moved to Ops at [Simple](http://simple.com)

And Wayne Witzel - Formerly of the Juju Core Team, now a core developer at [Ansible](http://ansible.com)

We'll cover topics ranging from Language Evolution, Monitoring, and Consultancy
to humanops, and perspectives from Open Source consumerism. Lots to ingest
in the final episode of the 2015 pre-recordings.
