####  Summary

In the spirit of getting a feel for System Zoo on air, it's fitting that the first
episode is catching up with Jesse Dearing. We'll talk through what
it's like being a Site Reliability engineer of [New Relic](http://newrelic.com)
- an application performance management company. And how the culture of friendly
engineering plays in his every day professional life.
